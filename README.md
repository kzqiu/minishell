# Minishell

This is a lightweight shell program written in C using only library functions and system calls.

Currently, the shell implements 'cd' and 'exit' as built-in commands, and has access to all executables provided by the environment. It also handles system signals in order to stay consistent with desired behaviors.

This project is a work in progress, with more customizability features and built-in commands to be added.
